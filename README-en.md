## üíî Fatal Flaws of Traditional Solutions

### Technical Bottlenecks of Reflection Solutions

Current mainstream solutions in the market rely on reflection mechanisms or Native interpreter hijacking based on interpreters. These solutions have fundamental technical flaws:

#### 1. Performance Disaster
```csharp
// Traditional reflection solution - poor performance code example
var uiManagerType = SmartReflection.FromType("UIManager", "Assembly-CSharp");
var instance = uiManagerType?.GetValue("Instance");
var uiManagerWrapper = SmartReflection.FromInstance(instance);
uiManagerWrapper.Call("ShowPanel", panelType, null, null, false, null);
```

**Performance Comparison Data:**
- Reflection call overhead: **50-100x of native calls**
- Memory allocation: **Massive temporary object creation**
- GC pressure: **Frequent garbage collection**

#### 2. Development Experience Nightmare
```csharp
// No IntelliSense, error-prone
uiManagerWrapper.Call("ShowPanel", wrongParam); // Compiles but crashes at runtime

// Unclear parameter types
wrapper.Call("SomeMethod", param1, param2, param3, param4); // What types are these parameters?

// Complex return value handling
var result = wrapper.Call("GetSomething");
var actualResult = (SomeType)result; // Manual type casting required
```

#### 3. Debugging and Maintenance Hell
- **Difficult error location**: Inaccurate exception stack traces
- **Poor code readability**: New team members struggle to understand and maintain
- **Difficult refactoring**: Any API changes may cause runtime errors

### Limitations of Hook Solutions

Traditional Hook solutions face new challenges in HybridCLR environments:

- **Ambiguous Hook targets**: Need to hook interpreters rather than specific functions
- **Compatibility issues**: Different game versions require re-adaptation
- **High technical barrier**: Requires deep Native development experience
- **High maintenance costs**: May fail with every game update

## üí¨ Frequently Asked Questions

### Technical Questions

#### Q: What is the core difference between your solution and traditional reflection solutions?
**A:** Our solution completely abandons reflection mechanisms, achieving native-level performance. Traditional reflection solutions require 50-100x performance overhead for each call, while our solution performs identically to forward development, providing complete IDE IntelliSense and compile-time type checking.

#### Q: Do you support development in native IL2CPP environments (non-HybridCLR environments)?
**A:** Due to technical resource allocation considerations, we currently do not support this. Additionally, such requirements overlap functionally with the UREngine decompilation engine, so future development possibility is relatively low.

#### Q: Does this framework invade the original DLL?
**A:** No, the injected DLL is like a plugin with zero invasion of the original DLL. Whether it's invasive depends entirely on your development approach. So original DLL updates won't affect your plugin at all.

#### Q: If a called function doesn't exist in the original game but exists in Unity engine API, can it auto-complete?
**A:** Unity engine-related classes and System classes cannot auto-complete, as they have been processed by Unity's AOT trimming mechanism during compilation. This problem exists even in HybridCLR's native environment and is an inherent limitation of Unity's AOT trimming mechanism.

#### Q: Which Unity versions and HybridCLR versions are supported?
**A:** We support mainstream Unity versions and HybridCLR versions. We continuously follow up on support for the latest versions.

#### Q: Do you support iOS platform?
**A:** Currently, we do not support iOS platform.

### Business Cooperation Questions

#### Q: Is HybridCLR environment support equivalent to game Mod development?
**A:** Yes, both are essentially the same concept, belonging to unofficial game plugins and Mod development categories. Our solution provides unprecedented development experience for Mod development.

#### Q: Is custom deployment charged separately for each game project?
**A:** Yes, we use a per-project pricing model. If there are large business needs, we can negotiate to reduce individual project costs or consider annual license cooperation plans. We provide flexible business models to meet different customer needs.

#### Q: Do you provide complete injection environment support?
**A:** We can provide injection plugin DLL support including emulators, real devices, full architecture, and all Android system versions. This includes complete development toolchain and automated deployment systems.

#### Q: What is the typical project delivery cycle?
**A:** Standard project environment setup and basic training usually complete within 1 week, or within 1 day if partners have Unity forward development experience. Complex project customization development cycles are evaluated based on specific requirements, but can save 60-80% development time compared to traditional solutions.

#### Q: What does technical support service include?
**A:** Includes 7x24 hour technical support, regular version updates, customized feature development, team technical training, performance optimization consulting, and other comprehensive services. We provide not just technical solutions, but a complete enterprise-level service system.

#### Q: How do you ensure solution stability and reliability?
**A:** Our solution has been verified in multiple large projects with comprehensive testing systems and quality assurance processes. We also provide long-term technical support to ensure continuous stable operation of the solution.

### Learning and Usage Questions

#### Q: What technical background do team members need to use this?
**A:** Our solution greatly lowers the technical barrier. Developers with basic C# and Unity development experience can quickly get started without deep reverse engineering or Native development background. We provide complete training and documentation support.

#### Q: Do you provide demos and trials?
**A:** Yes, we provide demo demonstrations during the technical consultation phase, allowing you to intuitively experience the solution's advantages. We can also provide small-scale proof of concept to ensure the solution fully meets your needs before formal cooperation.

#### Q: Is the learning cost high? What advantages does it have compared to traditional solutions?
**A:** Quite the opposite, our solution has extremely low learning costs. Since it provides an experience identical to forward development, personnel familiar with Unity development can get started within 1 day. Compared to traditional reflection solutions' complex syntax and debugging difficulties, our solution greatly improves development efficiency.

#### Q: Do you need to redeploy after a game update?
**A:** Our complete toolchain can automatically obtain hot-updated DLLs and re-depend on them to update hot-updated DLLs. In principle, if the game hasn't undergone major architectural changes, redeployment is basically unnecessary.
